## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker (for deployment)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` if available, or creating it from scratch. Add the following environment variables:

```
# The connection string for your PostgreSQL database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"

# A secret key for NextAuth.js. Generate a random string for this.
# You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate one.
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-for-nextauth"
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run the following command to apply the database schema. This will create all the necessary tables in your database based on the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

_Note: You may also want to seed your database with some initial data. A seeding script can be created and run with `npx prisma db seed`._

### 4. Running the Application

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üê≥ Deployment

This application is ready to be deployed using Docker. A multi-stage `Dockerfile` is included for building a production-optimized image.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ivolex-ecommerce .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --env-file .env ivolex-ecommerce
    ```
The application will be running on port 3000 of the Docker host. Ensure your `.env` file is present and correctly configured for the production environment.
